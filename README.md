# Solana Wallet dApp
A decentralized application built on Solana that demonstrates wallet connection, balance checking, airdrop requests, token balance checking, and message signing functionality. This dApp is built using React and the Solana Web3.js library.

## Features
- 🔗 Wallet Connection/Disconnection
- 💰 SOL Balance Checking
- 🪂 Airdrop Request System
- 💎 Token Balance Checking
- ✍️ Message Signing with Verification

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare)

## Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/LingwalAnkit/solana-wallet-dapp.git
- cd DApp
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@noble/curves": "^1.x.x",
    "@solana/wallet-adapter-react": "^0.15.x",
    "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui": "^0.9.x",
    "@solana/web3.js": "^1.x.x",
    "bs58": "^5.x.x",
    "react": "^18.x.x"
  }
}
```

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
2. Connect your wallet using the "Select Wallet" button
3. Interact with the following features:
   - Check your SOL balance
   - Request an airdrop (only works on devnet)
   - View your token balance
   - Sign messages and verify signatures

## Component Structure
### App.jsx
The main component that sets up the Solana wallet adapter providers and renders the main UI components.

### Components
#### Balance
- Displays the current SOL balance of the connected wallet
- Automatically updates when the wallet is connected

#### Airdrop
- Allows users to request SOL airdrops on devnet
- Input field for specifying the amount of SOL
- Displays transaction confirmation

#### TokenBalance
- Displays the balance of a specific token for the connected wallet
- Automatically fetches token balance when wallet is connected
- Supports multiple token accounts
- Configurable token mint address

#### SignMessage
- Enables users to sign messages using their wallet
- Verifies signatures using the ed25519 curve
- Displays the encoded signature upon successful signing
- Input field for message text
- Real-time signature verification

## Network Configuration
The dApp is configured to connect to Solana's devnet by default. You can modify the endpoint in `App.jsx`:
```javascript
<ConnectionProvider endpoint={'https://api.devnet.solana.com'}> // You can also use your own RPC URL from Alchemy 
```

## Token Configuration
To configure the token balance checking feature, modify the `TokenMintAddress` in the `TokenBalance` component:
```javascript
const TokenMintAddress = new PublicKey("YOUR_TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS");
```

## Styling
The project uses:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom CSS classes for wallet adapter UI
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Security Considerations
- All transactions are signed using the connected wallet
- Message signatures are verified using ed25519 curve
- Input validation is implemented for airdrop amounts
- Error handling for failed transactions and signatures
- Secure token account balance fetching
- Signature verification before displaying results
